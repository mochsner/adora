Mama's first mother's day was a good time spent with family! It wasn't a perfect day, but Adora was amazing (per usual) and very playful, and there was plenty of time for activities (like the start of an annual footprint record)!

Morning...

Dad had a long night and just wanted to sleep in the morning (shrugs)
