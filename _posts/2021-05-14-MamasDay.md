This mother's day post goes out to my favorite human, who delivered this little one to the world on Jan 29th, 2021!

Whether pumping, feeding, soothing, tickling, giggling or any other thing (e.g everything) with Adora, Ann-Marie's been rocking the past 3 months as a Mom, and Adora has such a great role model to look up to and learn from.

In terms of the day, it was overall a very good time spent with family! It wasn't perfect, but Adora was amazing (per usual), and there was plenty of time for activities (like the start of an annual footprint record).

Morning...
