I’m a real bubble blower!

Saying hello (and good-bye :( ) to my friends Meredith and Alan

Sadly, we’ve decided that living in our one bedroom apartment and being so far away from friend and family is not the right decision at this time for us. I cry too much and don’t like to always eat my food, causing my mommy a lot of stress. Sorry mommy! My friends Alan and Meredith helped us pack up in one morning and we moved on down back to Tennessee.

Daddy had a crucial moment here… he fed me AND got me to sleep! Otherwise we were going to stay at a hotel 2 hours away from home, but nope! He saved us.

<img src="assets/media/image51.png" />

<img src="assets/media/image29.png" />

Holy cow.. A crib?! This is where my mama slept when she was like me! Of course, I’m not actually going to sleep in it. That would be too easy of me :)

<img src="assets/media/image43.png" />

Bath time!

I tricked my mommy… she put me down so I’d wake up but joke is on her!! I stayed asleep!

I love mama!
