Since Easter Sunday, Week 9 started on Monday with a decent bout of reflux, but Adora was able to pull through with some help from our handy dandy syringe (throwback to the newborn days?!):

Monday seemed to last forever, but we eventually got her to sleep!

By Wednesday, Adora was doing a bit better, atleast enough so that we were excited about getting some cute pictures!

Thursday was exciting, as we knew we were expecting a special visitor... and Adora was starting to feel a lot better!

Then, sometime in the afternoon (a lot earlier than I expected - yay)... Aunt Emily came to the rescue!

Adora was also excited

We got to go on a walk (been a while since we'd been outside)!

And it was just overall a great day.

Saturday started out dad-less (he was doing a sleep study between 11pm-10am), but it was a great morning!

Oh right, we found the controller in a chip bag... somehow.

It was just great to see Emily, helping us to stay sane, eat well, and just hang out a little! 

After she left, I think we still had a few cute pictures before calling it a good weekend
