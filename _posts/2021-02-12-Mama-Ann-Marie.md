[@Ann-Marie](https://www.facebook.com/amttt), it's been an amazing 2 weeks seeing Adora grow, with us learning and growing with her. I love you, and I'm in awe of how much you've grown since this time seeing her 2 weeks ago. I'm continously falling more and more in love with you, just seeing you care for our baby the way you do (may or may not be due to having a great teacher... hard to tell, right [@Cindy](https://www.facebook.com/cindy.w.thompson.5)?). 

Anyway, big shout-out to God for bringing you (and Adora) into my life <3 I appreciate every second I can get during the workday to watch you two grow and love one another, and maybe even help out (my favorite). I knew you were going to be a great mom, but seeing you two... now I **KNOW** it. I'm so lucky to be a part of something so special!
