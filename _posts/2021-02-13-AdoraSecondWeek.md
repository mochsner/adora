The second week with Adora was definitely a fun, but interesting one.

## Feb. 6th, 2021 (Saturday)
We've been very lucky to have extra help from [Mama T](https://www.facebook.com/cindy.w.thompson.5) & [Mr. Matt](https://m.facebook.com/matt.thompson.948011?tsid=0.7256748592865133&source=result), so we were able to spend a bit of the weekend relaxing and just enjoying time with our daughter. 

We took a LOT of pictures, and even got to go sledding (Ann-Marie recorded from the car) really quick!

We decided to do a little photo op with our baby

## Feb. 7th, 2021 (Sunday)
This day was my last day before going back to work, and it was superbowl sunday. With the extra help we've had, we really just got to enjoy the (much less sleep deprived) time we had.

And here's a photo of Ann-Marie in our operations room. I love this one =)

## Feb. 8th, 2021 (Monday)
Monday was daddy's first day of work, so mommy and Gigi took a large brunt of the work. We decided that I'd do a few of the PM feedings, Gigi would do the 2 (or 3) overnight feedings, and I would wake up to do the 5-6 AM feedings. Mommy would pump every 3-4 hours, and would do many of the feedings during the day.

Here's a photo of Mama Ann-Marie with our little baby

Aunt Momo bought us pizza!

And of course, Gigi took great care of you as well :)

## Feb. 9th, 2021 (Tuesday)
Tuesday morning was my first time going to work with something more of what to expect, and I was setting the habit of waking up to feed you around 6 AM. Ann-Marie would get up with me, or a little after, and start to pump. This morning, you got to do some skin to skin with the best mama ever early in the morning.

Later in the morning, Pops made us hashbrowns!
![Pops hashbrowns!](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-19-18.png)

And then of course, I got to step away from my development work for a bit around 10 AM, when we fed you again.

![Ann-Marie 10AM feeding picture #2](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-20-31.png)

I got to take a break around lunch (because I missed you so much!), and wound up feeding you and doing some activities!

After lunch, Gigi got to hold you for a bit (holding her breath), too! Classic COVID-19 pictures.

Wednesday morning was an interesting one, in that you spit up a number of times through the night, and we had to shift some feedings around. We wound up waking back up at 5 AM (again, Gigi doing overnight feedings) to feed you, and were probably too tired for pictures.

When we started feeding you again in your next sleep/wake/eat cycle, *we* were a bit more awake...
![Ann-Marie with Adora](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-29-59.png)

But you, on the other hand...
![Adora asleep](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-30-23.png)

Once we got to around lunch, I had to shift a lot of focus to work. From the looks of it, Gigi was taking good care of you with Ann-Marie, though!

And then, of course, Ann-Marie. You both look so happy. I love this picture.

Adora: "Pay attention, mom!"
![Ann-Marie smiling distracted](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-32-53.png)

And then, you had your first tummy time on the floor (a play mat)!

And again, we're getting ready for bed! Nana Susi got this blanket for you, and you've definitely appreciated it for baths!

Goodnight, Adora!

Thursday morning, I don't remember much significant, other than you just being a straight cutie.

In the afternoon, we got a shot of you in your classic "champion" pose wake up stretch. You did this HABITUALLY. It's the greatest thing alongside the squeeks you always made with it (click for video)

You in your changing station..

## Feb. 12th, 2021 (Friday)
After my first week of work as a Dad, this Friday was especially exciting for me. I knew that I'd have a few days to spend with my two favorite girls and family. There was snow forecast for the weekend, and I was **almost there**!

The morning started fairly early, around 5-6 AM (no pictures), but I got a picture of my favorite girls sometime around 9 AM when my meeting was canceled. It was nice seeing them for a second.

![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-14-57-23.png)

Then, all of a sudden, in the middle of the day after lunch... I was NOTIFIED THAT ADORA's umbilical cord fell off!!! Our little one was finally becoming a full fledged human bean :')
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-50-13.png)

Of course, some cute pictures had to follow...

![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-52-02.png)

Adora went back down for a solid nap, only to wake up like a champ
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-52-35.png)
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-52-53.png)
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-52-59.png)

We had some trouble feeding her before our AWESOME planned dinner of King crab & Shrimp from Mad City Boiler, but Gigi wanted us all to eat and took great care of Adora, who'd had some trouble spitting up during her meal.

![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-54-14.png)

And then last but not least, Pops got a little shift in right before bed!
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-54-52.png)
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-55-03.png)

And off to bed she went...
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-55-21.png)

Only to be rudely waken up again in 90 or so minutes to eat :)
![](/assets/img/2021-02-13-17-55-56.png)

And again at 3 AM

## Feb. 13th, 2021 (Saturday)

We're currently on Saturday, but Mama had the courtesy to take a picture of Dad and Adora asleep, while she was pumping(?). Turns out, we don't look very different!
