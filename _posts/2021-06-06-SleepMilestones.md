title: "Sleep Milestones: 4 Mo. Training!"
date: 2021-06-05

While there are definitely tons of cute pictures from the end of May, beginning of June - we're going to focus on noteable events first!

- Getting more time outside
- More time standing (held of course)
- More tummy time
- Trying to eat all objects
- 4 months old (check-up doing well)
- More girly clothes (thanks GiGi)
- Weekend with GiGi
- Sleep training is going great (~5 days in)
- Weekend with Dad
- New toy (a bouncer)!
- Learned how to fly (like a football)

Now that things are a bit more settled in, Adora's been getting a lot more time outside on walks, an definitely learned to appreciate them a bit more! Starting out, Dad would take her out holding her, since she wasn't a big fan of the crib and Mom/Dad decided she needs to be able to see things a bit more ï¿½ Sometimes she gets to facetime grandma Su on the walks too!

She's started going with the top down a lot more, too! (sun sneezes are still a thing though)

She's still in her little bassonet crib at the moment, but she's been doing really well with it!
