Alright, so overall pretty rough week here, but getting better. Not quite as rough as 6 with the reflux, but I still liked to scream and decided that often eating just isn't worth it. Oh, and Dad still had a lot of high priority things at work this week. Still, I had some pretty cute moments, because well, I'm cute.

#### Sunday

Me not sleeping Sunday morning

### Friday 3/19
Adora celebrating 7 weeks (she was clearly as excited as us about it here) on her 10 AM anniversary!

Later in the Friday afternoon, we got to take her for a stroll :smiley: (Daddio just got done with a BIG push for his job's new application)!

Around 4 PM, it seems she was still pretty excited!
![](/assets/img/2021-03-28-00-12-29.png)

Her reflux has been getting much better at this point (thanks to Mama who's been so great & changing her diets to fit), but Daddio wanted to try play time at an angle just to be safe. Here she is on our "cheese" block that's used for us to be able to read in bed!

Oh, and lets not forget, Mommy and Daddy got to play a video game later on Friday as well -- first video game we've played in the last 2 months (we highly recommend "Biped" as a co-op game)

Later in the afternoon (maybe she slept real good), we got some REAL impressive facial expressions from her!
