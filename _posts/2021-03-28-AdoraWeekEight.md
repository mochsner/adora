title: "8 Weeks of Adora!!"
date: 2021-03-28
---

Oh man, it's been quite a while since we've posted, and hitting this eight week mark with Adora really feels good. Weeks 4-7 were admittedly very rough with some reflux that led to troubles eating and sleeping, but we've made it through.

Adora has hit so many great milestones, and I'm very excited to be writing about them again! To recap, so far, Adora has learned to:

- Roll over from front to back
- Hold tummy time (for a while)!!
- Slept up to a maximum of 6 hours
- Make (more human) facial expressions
- Be cute as ever

In terms of our favorite thing (pictures), here's a big 'ol photo dump of the little love for the last week! And of course, don't forget to stay tuned for our other posts recapping weeks 4-7 later!
