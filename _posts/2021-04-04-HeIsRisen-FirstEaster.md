HAPPY EASTER!!!

This year was a great one, as it was Ann-Marie and my first Easter as a true family (I proposed this time last year), our first Easter with Adora, and the first time we've had 72 degree weather in Wisconsin is _quite_ a while!

First thing in the morning, Adora ate great, and couldn't get enough of our skylight before falling back asleep like it was nothing (quite the difference from Saturday)

She also couldn't get enough of seeing herself back when she was first in Ann-Marie's belly

By the time of family picture (attempts), she may have been a bit tired though! =)

Today, we're thankful for our little family, and the man upstairs who died for us to be able to live the life we're living right now! We couldn't be more blessed.
